# kitchen_cabinet_iLogic
This project is an attempt to create a fully parametric kitchen cabinet model in Autodesk Inventor using iLogic. The goal is to explore and apply as many functional and automation features of iLogic as possible — from dimensional and material parameters to configurable components and adaptive design rules.
