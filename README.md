This project demonstrates how to build a fully parametric 3D model in Autodesk Inventor and control it using iLogic rules and a custom parameter form.
The workflow is based on the instructional video included in this repository.

🚀 Features

✅ Fully parameter-driven 3D model

✅ Custom form for editing key dimensions

✅ Automatic model updates through iLogic

✅ Clean and scalable parameter structure

✅ Demonstrates best practices for robust design automation

⚙️ How It Works

Open the provided Inventor part file (.ipt).

Modify values in the parameter form to change geometry.

The iLogic rule updates the model automatically after each change.

The workflow ensures stable relationships and predictable behavior, even under large parameter variations.

🧩 Example Workflow

Download the project files.

Open the main .ipt file in Autodesk Inventor.

Go to Manage → Parameters or open the custom iLogic Form.

Change dimensions such as width, height, spacing, or component size.

Run the iLogic rule if needed to trigger additional automated logic.

Observe how the model updates smoothly and consistently.

💡 Notes

The model is built to maintain stability over wide parameter ranges.

The structure follows clean naming conventions for clarity and maintenance.

The iLogic rule handles automatic regeneration and validation of values.

The included video explains the complete reasoning behind the design approach.

🧰 Requirements

Autodesk Inventor 2022 or newer

iLogic enabled (built-in)

Access to the project .ipt file
