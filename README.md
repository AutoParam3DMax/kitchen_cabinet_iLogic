Version 1 – Parametric Model Automation in Autodesk Inventor

This project demonstrates how to build a fully parametric 3D model in Autodesk Inventor and control it using iLogic rules and a custom parameter form.
The project represents step 1 in the approach to full parameterization of the drawer model.

🚀 Features

✅ Parameter-driven 3D model

✅ Custom form for editing key dimensions

✅ Automatic model updates through iLogic

✅ Clean and scalable parameter structure

✅ Demonstrates best practices for robust design automation

⚙️ How It Works

1. Open the provided Inventor part file (.ipt).

2. Modify values in the parameter form to change geometry.

3. The iLogic rule updates the model automatically after each change.

4. The workflow ensures stable relationships and predictable behavior, even under large parameter variations.

🧩 Example Workflow

1. Download the project files.

2. Open the main .ipt file in Autodesk Inventor.

3. Go to Manage → Parameters or open the custom iLogic Form.

4. Change dimensions such as width, height, spacing, or component size.

5. Run the iLogic rule if needed to trigger additional automated logic.

6. Observe how the model updates smoothly and consistently.

📌 Project Roadmap

This version includes only the first part of the parametrization process — a single part model with basic parameter control and one core rule.

Future versions will expand the automation with:

➕ Additional iLogic rules

➕ Multi-part parametric structure

➕ BOM parameterization

➕ Automated specification data

➕ Parametric drawing generation

➕ More advanced validation and configuration logic

This is just the foundation for a larger automation system that will grow step by step.

💡 Notes

The model is built to maintain stability over wide parameter ranges.

The structure follows clean naming conventions for clarity and maintenance.

The iLogic rule handles automatic regeneration and validation of values.

The included video explains the complete reasoning behind the design approach.

🧰 Requirements

 - Autodesk Inventor 2024 (Polish) or newer

 - iLogic enabled (built-in)

 - Access to the project .ipt file
